# Google Spam and Ham project :
In this Repo , I have done a Project on machine learning Natural Language Processing  problem statement Which requires a Huge dataset where I got it from 3rd part websites and don't worry I want to share the dataset with you and you can get it from here:

## Project Overview:

![App Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28294942/156881478-1c3d6df2-acf8-4a7e-847f-29fcb10aa9c1.png)


Using Pandas library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library.
since the data is having lot of Null values.I am going to take help of statistics concept to clean the data and if my approach was not a good way for doing this Project Please let me know.
But while focusing on Missing values I got it know Last 3 columns are completely NAN so I removed the last 3 columns.

yah After removing last 3 Columns the data becomes quite good where only 2 columns having values and remaining things are solved:

## I am following NLP pipeline for developing this project :

           - PipeLine of NLP Project:
           - Collect the data
           - Checking the Data information
           - Understand Problem statement
           - since it is text we need to follow NLP PipeLine
           - Need to convert them into numbers:
           - Using TF-IDF I am converting text to numbers
           - Split the Data
           - Model developement
           - Checking with below for selecting best model
             Naive bayes
             KNN
             Logistic Regression
             Decision Tree
             Random Forest 
           - Since the test accuracy and validation report is high
             for random forest.I am selecting it as my final model
           -  Read the Model and check once again
           - Using Flask Integrate with HTML and CSS
           - Generate outcome in localhost
           - Deploy in Server
           - API Generation
           - Share our Project API

## why spliting the data:

Here after converting the text data into numbers Using TF-IDF I am converting text to numbers.So here spited the data and balanced the length of X_train,y_train data then apply and develop the model


#### Finally entire data is set ready for Model developement Purpose:
Know I selected KNN , naive bayes , Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest for Model developement:

since after training the model I got the results of :

                  - KNN Accuracy : 0.9115992499330298
                  - NB Accuracy  : 0.975354942405572
                  - LR Accuracy  : 0.9678542727029199
                  - DT Accuracy  : 0.9662860250135944
                  - RF Accuracy  : 0.9798803697661773

since almost the results are very close to each other I stuck around to select the best model: No worries Since the test accuracy and validation report is high for random forest I am selecting it as my final model:
